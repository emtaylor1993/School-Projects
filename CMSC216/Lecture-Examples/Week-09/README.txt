For FileOpen.c:
   1. It relies on File.txt file.  Put some content in it before running 
      program.
   2. Remove NewFile.txt if it exists before running the program.
   2. Execute once to see files created.  Notice that File.txt is now empty.
   3. Change permissions of NewFile.txt to 400 and run again (to see access 
      failure).
