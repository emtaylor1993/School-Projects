After adding magic_quotes_gpc = On to the php.ini file, I
attempted to carry out the same SQL Injection attack that was
used for the previous tasks after adding a backslash before
the single quote that appears before $username. After doing 
this, the attack was unsuccessful. I believe this is because
the magic_quotes_gpc = On makes it so were are unable to match
the quote preventing us from logging in.

Some drawbacks to using string escaping include the following: 
Magic quotes can destroy data that isn't written unescaped to 
a database. In a form (for example, a login form), magic quotes
will escape the data entered if a form that hasn't been completed
is shown again to the user.
