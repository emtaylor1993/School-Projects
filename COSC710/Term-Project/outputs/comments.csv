(3187,2164,"\r\n  As with other topics of Starbucks employees, it boils down to training.  However, I think you might be suprised at the number of people in general do not know espresso contains less caffeine than the average drip coffee.  I'm not sure if the true level of caffeine in the drinks can be regulated anyway.  It would depend a lot on the brew temperature and brew length combined with the size grind, roast level, and so on.  The FDA can't even efficiently regulate prescription drugs which are supposed to have a stringent quality control so how can you expect them to regulate caffeine levels in a product that depends on so many variables?  Not that I'm defending Starbucks (I disagree with many aspects of their business), but likening them to a drug dealer seems a bit irresponsible and misleading (which in turn causes you to be no more responsible than the practice that you are addressing.) \r\n",rrmeyerh,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=087500000004EIFAA2,3/19/2008 5:55 PM)

(It pains me even more to see kids chugging down Rockstars and triple lattes, not knowing how much this will effect them in latter years).As for drug dealer, besides the stigma with the name, I think thats actually pretty accurate description.  If people were honest with themselves, though the drinks taste good, its the drug that people are going for...and keeping coming back for.Thus they are drug dealers...dealers of a powerful drug...a drug that happens to currently be 'socially acceptable' and used by the majority of the population, because it fuels the very zeitgeist of our age.Once people start deepening, desiring quality over quantity, slowing down over speeding up, real-time vs. virtuality, my hunch is that the appeal of the drug will lessen.We'll want to be ourselves, the full range of human moods and experience not constantly beefed up by any particular drug-swing.Just my two cents. \r\n",SparkGuy,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=087500000004EIFAA2,3/19/2008 6:11 PM)
(3189,2164,"\r\n  Some good resources about the truth about caffeine:\nhttp://healing.about.com/od/readertips/qt/truthcaffeine.htm (book review at about.com)\n\nhttp://stresshelp.tripod.com/id7.html\n\""Clinical Psychologists in the USA have carried out research which indicates that caffeine can be a factor in causing or exacerbating depression and that on removal of caffeine from the diet, depression lifts, and on re-introducing it to the diet again, depression worsens. Caffeine can have an anti-depressant action in small amounts but can have a depressive effect in larger amounts. Caffeine users report significantly higher depression scores when compared to non-users. The higher the total caffeine intake, the more likely the subjects were to suffer from depression. The researchers were unable to identify a clear cut dosage level which produced symptoms.\n\nVitamin B6 is one vitamin involved in the manufacture of serotonin (this chemical is low in people with anxiety and depression). Caffeine depletes the body of vitamin B6, this may be another route where caffeine is involved in depression. \""\n\n\nhttp://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20050728-000004.html\n\nhttp://www.holymtn.com/tea/caffeinetruth.htm\n\n\""Addiction risk. More than half of regular caffeine users are apt to suffer withdrawal if they quit abruptly, says Griffiths. You can suffer after giving up just one cup of coffee a day. His new research also finds it takes only three days of taking in 300mg a day to get hooked. Kids are vulnerable, too, says University of Minnesota researchers. Daily for two weeks, 8- to 12-year-olds were given the caffeine in three to five soft drinks. Then the caffeine was cut off. Within 24 hours, the kids' mood and mental performance deteriorated. They had slower reaction times and shorter attention spans. Symptoms lasted two weeks. \""\r\n",SparkGuy,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=087500000004EIFAA2,3/22/2008 12:38 PM)
(3190,2165,"\r\n  A number of folks have responded to other posts on first aid with a concern for legal liability.  This is a legitimate concern, but should not interfere with a private citizen's moral (versus legal) right to render first aid.The state of California has a Good Samaritan law that protects first aid responders to some degree, with the following provisos -- (1) you are administering emergency medical care, (2) you act reasonably, based on current best practices, and (3) you don't exceed the limits of your training.So treating first-degree burns with a cold water flush is covered, but performing open-heart massage next to the espresso machine is not.That said, anyone can be sued at anytime for any reason -- that is why commercial establishments must carry lots of liability insurance anyway.A reasonable policy (likely to play well with tort-trial jurors) would be to keep a high-quality well-stocked first aid kit, fire extinguisher, and automated external defibrillator prominently displayed behind the counter, and train all staffers in basic fire safety, first aid, and life support (CPR), with provision for more advanced first aid training for those willing.  If Starbucks were to go the extra distance and pay for the training, pay for annual recertification, and pay their employees to attend it, and keep a good eye on safety and emergency preparedness, they would actually be better protected against safety lawsuits.  First aid training is astoundingly cost-effective, and even a high-end first aid kit (trauma pack) costs surprisingly little.  If Starbucks in-store surveillance videos depicted a well-handled crisis and competent staff doing their best, this would be the strongest possible argument in their defense against any lawsuit.  Far better it shows that, then a bunch of clueless folks milling about, with no aid rendered.  Organizations like the American Red Cross, AHA, CERT, and DAN provide high-quality first aid and CPR training, all of which are nationally recognized.The sad truth is that in disasters most people freeze up and do nothing, lawyers or no lawyers.  Good training in disaster preparedness kicks your cortex into gear when it is needed most.  In certain cities (San Diego and Seattle in my experience) a surprisingly large portion of the customer population already has first aid training (based on their outdoor recreational activities such as scuba diving and mountaineering) so keeping a first aid kit available on-site at Starbucks could prove a life-saver.I imagine that the first news story that provides cellphone video of a well-trained team of Starbucks barristas saving somebody's life with an AED defibrillator (a $1000 unit) will provide plenty of journalists with one-liners about \""kick-starting your heart at Starbucks without the espresso\"" and priceless positive public relations that advertising money just can't buy.  And if it turns out to be a lawyer (or local celebrity) who keels over while waiting in line, you can expect the follow-up story to run annually...  :)  -- Bo Shmorhay \r\n",shmorhay,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=087500000004EKJAA2,6/7/2008 5:43 PM)

Obviously some people will automatically say, well if it affects animals, it will do the same for humans. Not always the case.\nI doknow the chemical itself methylene can cause the certain cancer you stated above, but that is as a chemical, breathing it, having close contact to it, it's also used in a lot of household items, cleaning products, which you should change to more organic ways to clean your home instead of the harsh chemicals used nowadays to begin with.

(13020,7305,"\r\n  Hi Serpico,\nThe NIH and EPA both list methylene chloride (aka Dichloromethane or DCM) as a probable carcinogen. OSHA likewise lists the chemical as a potential occupational carcinogen.\nTo quote the NIH, \""Dichloromethane is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals.\"" Reference: http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/Dichloromethane.pdf\nThe EPA classifies it as a a B2 carcinogen, meaning that while animal testing clearly indicates the chemical causes cancer, there is insufficient evidence from epidemiologic studies to confirm human carcinogenicity. Reference: http://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0070.htm\nI am not claiming that Starbucks decaf causes cancer. I certainly hope not since I drink at least one grande cup a day. I understand that DCM evaporates at 100-degrees and that Starbucks roasts their beans at 400-degrees subsequent to treating them with DCM, thus reducing the amount of DCM in the coffee to unmeasurable levels. My point, and thus the placing of this idea under \""social responsibility\"", is that all that DCM has to go someplace after it is used. Starbucks use of this chemical is not in keeping with their stated goal of being responsible and doing things that are good for the planet. I personally do no like knowing that my patronage of Starbucks is being used to support purchase and use of DCM.\r\n",nbobbin,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=08750000000HXioAAG,7/2/2011 12:40 PM)

(13055,7324,"\r\n  Organic milk can rise profits to Starbucks and satisfaction of customers. This is just one way of doing it: Cost: organic milk is more expensive. Solution: buy only whole organic milk! Why: because its rich flavor and unmatched creaminess will make you money, and this is how: Trick from my kitchen, see comparison below, and try it yourself:1 cup of 2% regular milk = 130 calories and creamy.  cup organic whole milk +  cup of water = 75 calories and a creamier!Yes, it is true. Try it out Starbucks! In stores: By implementing this change in stores, the process behind the production line would remain the same. The cost of milk in a latte would then be half the price of the expected full cost of organic milk, which is less than 100 percent of the cost of traditional milk. This is cost savings, calories savings, and creaminess increase. Note: half whole oranic milk solution will never be original 2% milk, and more importantly the half-Oranic-latte would never want to be the standard 2% latte. Why? Because it is simply better, tastier, healthier for us and kinder to exploited cow moms.Further, if Starbucks buys our organic milk from local farmers, Starbucks will become a first global coffee business that supports local farmers and holds to the highest standard coffee and milk in each latte cup.

Your cup of coffee pays for a lot: Everything from ethical sourcing practices with farmers, to baristas with health care, to all the good things that Starbucks does.\nMy suggestions for you would be to consider buying coffee in the grocery store, andbrew at home. That's a lot cheaper. You might like the Seattle's BestCoffee brand of whole bean coffees - It is sourced by Starbucks but a little cheaper.\nIn the stores, I would highly recommend you bring in your own cup. You do the earth a favor, andthen you save ten cents off your drink by bringing in your own cup.\nAnd get a Starbucks gift card and register it. You can put aslittle as $5 on it in the stores. A registered Starbucks card can open the door to certain perks like a free drink on (or about) your birthday, certain syrups free, and a free tall any beverage if you buy a pound of whole bean coffee in the stores. (Actually, you get a free tall any drink - and the register does all of these perks automatically - even if you buy one-half pound of the special Reserveline of coffees, but not all stores have those).\nSorry this link is not clickable:\nhttp://www.starbucks.com/card/rewards\nGood luck!\r\n",Melody,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=08750000000HXSHAA4,6/29/2011 5:47 PM)

I have experienced something similar, not at Starbucks, but at work when everyone (including my boss) was chatting about their home lives (i.e. \""I'm getting married next year\"" or \""My boyfriend is just starting college\"" or \""I'm thinking of starting a family once I get my career on track\"") I said something about going to the movies with a girl I was dating. Later I was told by my boss that it was innapropriate to 'make personal comments' in the workplace.\nSomething in the article reminded me of that moment:\n\""I do know however, the fact that Jefferys sexuality was brought into  the conversation (and it obviously was for me to know about it) is  inappropriate. The woman (Who I will refer to going forward as the  Manager although she may have been someone from Human Resources) spoke  to him in a sharp condescending manner. She told him that they were not  interested in his politics or beliefs and his thoughts were down right  offensive to his co-workers. They did not want to hear about his  personal life. When Jeffrey pointed out that they ALL talked about their  personal lives (during the course of the conversation I learned that  the manager had a daughter that went to tennis camp and another one of  the women had a birthday coming up so the irony and the hypocrisy of  that statement was mind blowing.) That his beliefs were not welcome at  Starbucks. She went on, an on and on talking about leadership building  workshops where she learned to Keep it to herself (again I will  remind you of tennis camp). She was even so condescending to tell him,\nIt might not be today, it might not be tomorrow, but ten years from now you will thank me for this\nAgain, none of us were there, BUT if this article is true then it does seem to be a bit of an LGBT issue. You shouldn't be overly personal at work but you shouldn't have to hide anything if others mention their lives and families. (If everyone is expected to be completely anonymous and not mention spouses or children, clearly you should follow suit, but rarely has this been a rule...That would be like telling people you can't wear engagement rings at work because they show that you're in a relationship, which is a 'personal detail')\r\n",Barista_Marie,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=08750000000HWBFAA4,6/18/2011 12:32 AM)

(18452,8882,"\r\n   Chicagosbrocks does make a poignant point. In todays economic environment, the word homeless has more than one connotation. However, I will confess, when I think of a homeless guy what usually comes to mind is an unkempt, scruffy down and outer in dire need of a bath, pushing his or her worldly personal effects in an appropriated shopping cart, and who may or may not be sheltered in a cardboard box in an unsanitary alleyway. And who is, more times than not, in a chemically-induced haze looking for his or her next cigarette and bottle of Thunderbird or Night Train.\n But even if the guy [is living] next to the Starbucks refuse dumpster out back, he or she could, perhaps, still serve a useful and productive purpose in the community. If he or she is ambulatory and capable enough to carry a cardboard sign that reads: Homeless, please help, God bless, he or she could certainly volunteer his or her services by walking up and down that same walkway, with broom in the hand, sweeping the curbside and sidewalk (providing that he or she does not have maniacal tendencies, after all, a broom could be used as a formidable weapon).

Of course I took into consideration that there would be some conditions that would limit some peoples abilities to work in an environment like Starbucks. I also believe ones health and and access to the means of presenting themselves as a clean person is very important. I wouldn't want the stereotypical person that is more like a bum taking care of me at Starbucks.\nBut there are some good people out there who found themselves in a bad situation they never saw coming, during the economic problems that have plagued us over the past few years. Many people find themselves homeless after simply losing a job. The only point I was trying to make clear is that there are people who just need a chance. And as I said in this post and previous posts. We have a population of retirees, veterans, handicapped and even homeless people that could use a job. I know Starbucks wants their people to multitask and do everything, but I do believe that some stores could use help in stores on the customer side of the counter. I know the store I go to, they can't keep up at the condiment bar or with the garbage because they get that busy.\nStarbucks is a leader. They could put a program together to help some people out. And if and when they are barista material, maybe at a later time when they get on their feet, they could move on up. Some may be just content with doing the menial jobs the baristas frown upon doing.

In many areas any receptacle not emptied daily is classed as waste storage.Third, people need to follow instructions and put the only correct recycleable in the correct recepticle--the biggest obstacle of all\nRecycling starts as a personal responsibility.Be sure you are doing your part with personal cups and doing your own recycling.Do not depend on (or require) others to do your recycling for you.If you are staying in the store you should be either using a \""for-here cup/glass\"" (yes you can have your Frappuccino in a glass) or your own mug that you brought.The actual amount of material put in recycle bins that is actually is recycled is only 60% to 80%, even less in some areas.

(25727,11750,"\r\n  Dear Starbucks,It's fair to say that the people in holland are very heavy coffee drinkers. Coffee is by far the most popular drink in holland. Every duchtman (including small children and old folks) drinks about 165 litres coffee a year. Seccond place is tea with 100 litres. And then, at number 3 with only 97 litres are all kinds of sodas combined. The number of litres coffee and tea is still growing every year. It's only fair to say that we drink most of our coffee at home. This is beacause there are almost no fast serving coffeeshops in our cities. This might be a reason to open up some more stores in Holland. Nowadays I have to travel to schiphol or Paris to get one of your beverages. I'm ashamed to say that I often do. I travel more than 30 mile's for one or maybe two white mocca drinks.  I go to schiphol at least once a month. A lot of my friends do the same. Imagine how often we would visit a local store. Please open one up in The heage. It's one of the largest cities in Holland. You might have heard of us. The international court is located here as wel as almost all embasseys. I think there might be a lot of people who already know starbucks from other countrys and are desperate for one of our own. So, if you want us to beg, we'll do that, if you want us to pleed, we'll do that. For now you'll just have to do with....

(25744,11757,"\r\n  Not to trample on a well-paced rant, but Starbucks has a quality control problem and they know it. They wouldn't be installing new espresso machines, closing stores to retrain baristas, and buying out the company who builds the Clover brewing system if they didn't. Their coffee isn't a good as it used to be.They also have a whale of a fight on their hands- and they know that too. Starbucks stopped being a truly cozy hang-out several refits ago. The current furniture looks nicer than Dunkin Donuts, but it isn't very comfortable. I don't want to spend three hours sipping burnt espresso in a hard chair with a metric f-ton of cds and nick-knacks begging for my hard-earned money. If I'm in and out in five minutes anyway, why not try out Dunkin Donuts brew? Add to that the growth of smaller chains like Caribou and the development of hyper-specialty chains like Dunn Brothers who actually roast on there coffee in each store and therefor serve a vastly superior product in terms of freshness and aroma, Starbucks cannot afford to relax one bit. People are fast discovering that there is better espresso to be found and customer loyalty is only as good as your last latte. Heck- there were a Caribou or a Dunn Brothers or a Gloria Jean's or a really good mom-and-pop shop within 30 miles of me, my local Starbucks would never see a dime of my money. Since I have no other option, I'm hoping Starbucks ignores your post and starts brewing a better cuppa and cappa. The bottom line is this: even 500 pound gorillas have to work to keep their mates and their clan position- or else some young stud will come in and take it all away. \r\n",BigJack,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=087500000004MOWAA2,3/25/2008 4:45 PM)
(25745,11757,"\r\n  BigJack - We used to have Gloria Jeans here. Starbucks killed off every last one. I've had Caribou coffee.  No big deal. Also, I don't want to smell the coffee roasting. I used to frequent 3-4 store chains that roasted their own coffee on the premises. Their big problem is always quality control. The machines they use make a lot of inconsistent batches, and tend to be only as good as the underpaid employees operating them feel like being.  When you have 15,000 stores, that kind of inconsistency would be chaos. They might as well be 4000 regional coffee companies.Why not try Dunkin? I did. It sucks. They have to put splenda into the non-fat lattes without asking you because it masks the weak amount of espresso that they stick in there. These are drip houses. If you like drip, and particularly their drip, go for it. Otherwise they don't have much on the Starbucks.Does Starbucks close locations? Yep. All large retail companies do. They don't always find the right location and clientle. That isn't going to change any by this initiative, or by anything really as they grow. Their closures are still fractional to their overall successes. Please show me one other coffee company who can approach Starbucks for such consistent uniformity of excellence and do it on their scale. There is none.  McDonalds isn't about quality. They're about volume. Dunkin is the same. So Starbucks finds itself in the unique position of being both a high quality company and a volume company. \r\n",apljedi1,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=087500000004MOWAA2,3/26/2008 6:33 AM)

That is my own personal blog. There are NO ads on my blog so you can safely browse the content. It is just about Starbucks.\nYour idea is about trying out new sugary flavors like pumpkin spice, gingerbread, and eggnog. I have seen stores sampling these beverages when the promo is brand new.Ask your local baristaif they will be sampling out new promo flavors.Order what you want, but explain that you haven't tried it before. If you really don't like eggnog, or gingerbread, or whatever, ask for a different drink to be made.\nSadly though, I have to vote your idea down because it is all about encouraging people to drink thesedrinksthat have almost no relationship to \""coffee\"". I think some people forget there is a whole bean wall. The shotof coffee in your beverage is Starbucks Espresso Roast pulled as an espresso shot: If youhaven't tried that as a drip coffee athome, I recommend that. It is delicious.\nIf you have a home espresso maker, I suggest trying other beansfor your espresso shot. You can pull a shot of Kenya even as an espresso shot, if you are doing so at home.

Tons of village folk came to my city, and my Starbucks happened to be on the main road that runs straight through from their downtown street an hour away. Our numbers went through the roof. We had 2x the number of customers. And since the smaller city is more affluent and a bit exclusive, many customers bought lots of stuff since they brought plenty of money.\nFairs, big shopping mall sales, sports tournaments, even high school sports teams, etc can unexpectedly cause product shortages.

I cringe to think of the vituperative debates from S.G. being transferred from that website to this one.If you really read S.G. you'll find that there is a large contigency of contributors there who predict doom and gloom for Starbucks, and smell buy-out vis a vis Nelson Peltz or Pepsi (?), and so a small hardcore group of partners are constantly having to stand up for the company and its decisions.As for Leadership Conference.  We'll see. There is nothing like face to face communication. That is a lesson that it getting lost with modern technology. Face to face communication has the potential to REALLY energize people in a way that seeing someone on an LCD screen wouldn't. It might be the shot in the arm that Starbucks needs.I have clients I deal with in a professional manner, and I prefer that as much as possible, I deal with my clients face to face rather than over the phone, or through a video link connection.

And MSI assumes that each idea stands on its own, has only one idea, the creators have another idea and often lump in 3 or 4 ideas.\nIt all really comes back to the need for full time moderation for a quality site.

And people who order this drink sit in a different area of the store than everyone else?   They shouldn't be sitting with other people, people who didn't order that specific \""drink of the day\""?  And the barista, the employee, should deliver it to the person who ordered it, who's sitting in a different area of the store than the rest of the customers?  \n\nAnd because the customer want s to order the \""coffee drink of the day\"", they \""would not have to wait in the regular line\""?

Same deal here.\n\nStarbucks is closing 600 stores this year, not opening new ones.  My suggestion is for improvement.  Perhaps sticking to the 'same way you've always worked' will result in 600 closings next year too.  When you want things (store decline) to change, you must be willing to change yourself.

I have heard some partners at my fav sbx talking about their escapades the night before at a local bar and even practicing \""slamming\"" shots because one partner was approaching her 21 birthday and wanted to be ready for her legal drinking debut. When you see partners \""slamming\"" shots of water it is disconcerting.

(117913,55265,"\r\n  meyerhd: I understand where you are coming from if you are hearing inappropriate conversations, I feel the same way if I am going into a restaurant and people are talking about things that are rather uncomfortable to hear. I do agree that only a certain level of conversation is acceptable. I do think however, that your suggestion is slightly on the extreme side. For instance if I go into a restaurant, and the people only are allowed to talk about work, they will not be happy, they will not care and I will probably not get good service. On the other extreme if they talk about anything, include all kinds of inappropriate conversation, and do not greet me when I come in, and are not polite, I am not going to be back. So I suppose I consider these criteria 1) Are they happy and smiling? 2) Are they having a good time? 3) Is their conversation appropriate (things you would say in front of a child) 4) Did they break off their conversation when they saw me and gave me a genuine greeting? 5) Were they polite? \n//////\nThose are the criteria that I consider important when it comes to evaluating service and whether I would want to continue to go regularly to an establishment. There are also turn offs, such as 1) Are they unhappy? 2) Do they seem downtrodden or too tightly controlled? 3) Are they rude? 4) Do they wait to long to greet me and sound insincere? 5) Are they too busy talking to pay attention to me? 6) Is their conversation workplace appropriate?\n////\nLike I said, I consider the level of the conversation, and whether they break it off to greet the customer and politely considerately take their order to be very important. I think your idea is a little on the extreme side, however, if certain stores have people who are talking about things such as the above person mentioned (such as slamming shots and drinking,  and their bar escapades) then perhaps their particular manager should talk to them about the appropriatness about the conversations they are having at the workplace. And in that case I would suggest talking to the manager of that particular establishment about those concerns. Just my opinion though. \n///\nKjminton: Thank you. I do agree that that is not appropriate conversation, if I went to a restaurant and heard that I would probably not be back. It's all about the level of the conversation, customer response time, and giving a genuine greeting and a smile.\r\n",Barista77777,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=087500000005I8rAAE,2/25/2009 7:49 PM)
(117914,55265,"\r\n  Maybe we're making some progress here...  My suggestion is not meant to be extreme, rather to return the focus toward the customer.  In the cases I cite, the focus is clearly not on the customer because the employees do not notice the look of displeasure on their faces that I can so easily observe.  There are numberous topics outside of 'work' that would be fine: weather, sports, economy, gardening, astrology, who cares?  The point is that if the conversation is about something that is not 'exclusive' to the employee, perhaps the customers that I observe would not appear to be offended because they are being 'excluded' from the 'atmosphere' of the store.  If you're talking about the weather, a customer can relate to that and could even add their insight if so inclined.  If you're talking about what you did last night, even if the customer had insight to add, they would probably refrain out of respect for your 'privacy'.\r\n",meyerhd,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=087500000005I8rAAE,2/26/2009 5:34 AM)
(117915,55265,"\r\n  Again, this converstation is another example what customers desire. When customers walk into any retail store they are not only seeking merchandise they are seeking the experience of it too. They want to feel special and acknowledged that they are there at \""your store\"", when they have other choices. And that should be the job of any \""retail clerk\"" to make the customer feel special, wanted and their purchase is meaningful. There is nothing worse IMHO then walking into any retail store and being ignored and not appreciated.

I still put mayo on french fries, which is pretty common in many parts of Europe. \nIt is you Starbucks King who introduced Krispy Kreme into this discussion. The issue is ketchup where there is demand. If customers at Krispy Kreme had products they wished to ketchup on,. would not Krispy Kreme be remisss in not providing it? I agree, there likely aren't many who would put ketchup on a dounut. But somewhere out there, that person has likely learned to bring their own. In the case of Starbucks, many of the products offered are by custom eaten by many with ketchup. Why not offer ketchup for those who wish to use it? This does not tarnish Starucks images, it only positively reinforces the opinion that Starbucks is concerned about meeting its customer's needs, and expectations.*\n\nOn a completely personal note to Starbucks King, I grew up in household where reaching for a salt shaker in sight of the cook was frowned upon. An insult to their skills and training. It was expected that the food leaving the kitchen was prepared to the likes and desires of those being served, individually tweeked to different family member's tastes and preferences. The salt shaker, albeit present, was rarely if ever used, even by guests, more of a decoration, than anything else. Ketchup was present on the table, as was any other choice of a myriad of condiments, when the type of food demanded it. I was dining out with a friend this past week at a sit down restaurant, and I actually reached for a salt shaker to salt a sliced tomato, and found myself apologizing to my friend for doing so. He chose the restaurant, and I worried that he would think that by salting my tomato the food was improperly prepared.

They want their cup of coffee and a pastry (or two), and they are either headed off to where ever they are planning to go, or they're going to take their coffee and pastry and din in for an hour or so. Having 100 variety of pastries would mean stores would have to increase their pastry order, which means if they do not sell those pastries, money spent on purchasing those pastries would go down the drain. It does not make sense for Starbucks stores to offer pastries in bulk. If one wants items in bulk, they should go to a Costco Wholesales. It is expected at Costco Wholesales (or whatever else wholesales warehouses) that customers will buy items in bulk. However, it is not expected at Starbucks that customers will come in purchase pastries in bulk. Does it happen? Yes, but very unlikely in the hundreds. Often? Probably not.

Let's move forward and look at McDonald's recent announcement that they will experiment, and move forward with CUSTOMER customization of their burger offerings.

As baristas we are in the people business not in the coffee business and that seems to be frequently overlooked. Starbucks is a place for conversation and thrives through a sense of community.\nRay Oldenburg (1989,1991) suggest that the ideal third place consists of an \""anchor\"" of community. He argues that hallmarks of this environment are: free or inexpensive, food and drink, highly accessible, involve regulars, be welcoming and comfortable to new and old friends.\nCampers are more than welcome to come in and just sit, all day long and never make a purchase. This is not going to change. I propose finding an alternative solution to the seeting issues that exist in stores. How do you balance the needs of customers, like yourself who come for the coffee and would like to visit, and those who camp? It's a very fine line. But I think it goes beyond meetering the internet and provinding an unwelcoming environment to campers.\n@Melody I agree, meetering wifi is not going to magically solve the lack of seeting issues that are present at some stores.\n\r\n",Jashirri,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=08750000000HzfdAAC,3/20/2012 2:15 PM)

(202932,98520,"\r\n  Steve1, in looking through that Forbes website, it is clear that Howard Schultz is a very very well paid CEO.  One of the top in the country perhaps.  However, the huge problems that Starbucks has, at least in my opinion, is NOT because of his salary. Starbucks has far worse problems than Howard's salary.  I've ranted about them often: Public perception that Starbucks is a dime a dozen, premium competitors that didn't exist 10 to 15 years ago, and public perception that an espresso beverage at Starbucks is an inferior product because it produced on a manual machine, to name just a few issues.Just as Starbucks was built on no-advertising, and word of mouth, man-on-the-street conversation, so it can be destroyed. There is nothing worse than when your friends start saying in casual conversation with each other:  I went to Starbucks and I was hardly noticed by the baristas engaged in their own conversations, and they threw my drink together ... That can bring down large ships.  Lots of small holes leaves plenty of room to take on water.Starbucks wanted to be a \""growth company\"" and be large scale.  Be careful what you wish for: You just might get it.I will give you Steve1 that there are almost no CEOs with the internal constitution of James Sinegal (Costco CEO) who apparently earns less than 500,000 a year as a CEO.  He's a bargain CEO and Costco should keep him forever for a variety of reasons.

The small-batch Starbucks coffees (available only a few stores) are heavenly and of the very highest quality.  You can't do something that amazing and bring it to 14,000 stores. He's bringing partners together to excite them about the business - leadership conference. He's bringing yummy food into their stores - oatmeal and Piadinis (sp?) - I'm spending more now than ever because of all the new choices.

Every day, around the globe, we strive to make a difference in the world. As such, we sincerely applaud people like you who are also taking action and making a difference in the world or in someones life.\n\nHowever, from the start of our company and up to now our main products are coffee and food items.

Some Borders stores feature local writers. You may want to check with your local Borders to determine if this is possibility.   At Starbucks, you are always welcome to come enjoy reading accompanied with one of our delicious crafted coffee drinks.\n\nAgain, I appreciate you for using this forum to share your ideas with rest of the Starbucks community.

Their Iced Coffee (Original) is decent too.\nI have also hadthe Burger King Mocha Iced Coffee and found it to be very good, BUT also high in sugar, but not real sweet like the frappe.\nSince I am not going to SBfor fraps anymore I havebeen making my own at home brewing fresh strong coffee, adding sugar to my taste and coffeemate, chill and blend with ice...........I not only save money, but get to enjoy an ice cold frap to the best copy-cat I can make. Infact my friend calls me when she's coming over and says....\""Have me a frap ready\"" She too is disappointed in SB and stopped spending her money there.........\r\n",1Ristretto,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=08750000000Gwf9AAC,7/18/2010 3:39 AM)

It tasted like water and didn't have any flavor to it!!! I went there again a different day and got the same drink I always get and this time it was back to the way it tasted. A couple of day's later I got the same thing but this time it tasted horrible!!!! I asked \""why does it taste different\""? and he said \""we have a new frappacino recipe\"". So ever since I saw the new frappacino comercials I never went back to Starbucks again!!! I have now been going to different coffee shops, even though they don't sell frappacino's at all. I have had to adjust to something else. The make it your own Fraps. aren't the best. But I think those who liked the old Fraps. and the new Make It Your Own Fraps. should still be able to get what thay want. That way all customers will be happy. I always went to starbucks but now i don't! I do hope that they will read these comments and do something about it. You don't have to take away it. You can make a compromise. Like the one i suggested in my comment. Please hear us out, and do something about it. The new ones and tastless.

However, if you eat healthy most of the times and exercise, a frappuccino once in a while is not going to spoil your diet.\nCalories\nThe tall 12-oz. size of the Starbucks Light Coffee\nFrappuccino has 90 calories, the grande 16-oz. size contains 110 calories and the 20-oz. venti size has 190 calories. These calories primarily come from the sugar content of the drinks.\nThe light coffee frappuccinos are fat-free and have 20 to 39 grams of sugar and 2 to 5 g protein, depending on the size. They also contain 8 to 15 percent of the recommended daily value of calcium.\nTips\nThe light coffee frappuccino, along with the other light flavors, is already a better choice compared to the standard frappuccinos on Starbucks' menu. To further reduce calories, you can request less syrup and resist the temptation to add whipped cream. Portion control is also key--ordering the tall size over the venti will satisfy your frappuccino craving while keeping calories low.\nAlso your drink:\nStarbucks Cinnamon Dolce Frappuccino\\u00c2\\u00ae Light Blended Coffee-grande\nCalories 140\nFat.5gr\nCarb. 29gr\nProtein 5gr\nSodium 230gr.\nGood Luck :)\r\n",Serpico,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=08750000000HeHzAAK,8/31/2011 10:51 AM)
