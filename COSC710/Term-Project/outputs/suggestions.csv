(9,"As a former Barista, my ideas and insight into the business are tremendous.  But they all come down to one thing, 'we've' created the monsters that currently populate 'our' stores.  A 15,000 calorie (estimated liberally) Venti-Strawberries, Cream, Java Chip, Caramel and everythign else Frappuccino is not a positive offering, it's an indulgence, nor are a substantial portion of the other retail, food, and beverage offerings found at your present day local Starbucks positive.  Nor is nickel and diming customers for everything from wi-fi to drink toppings.  'We' lost the heart and soul of the business (\""Pour Your Heart In To It\"" anyone?, which I dutifully read and bought into) in ratios, seasonal themes and promotions, up-selling, inventory turns and generally taking the low road in \""value-added products and services.\""  I visit my local Starbucks now, as I am sure many do, exclusively to purchase... beans, which I also regularly buy at the grocery store so I can avoid visiting my local store.  Because at my local store, not only do I find too loud music, long lines, intattentive service, and messy bathrooms, but I find dump-truckloads of negativity and over retail-ization.  Loud, over-privledged children and their high-calorie, zero nutrition frappuccino's, self indulgent and frequently upset adults, short on caffeine, high on sugar withdrawl, all seeking an experience \""WE\"" no longer provide to them, of course 'we' still provide the 'fix.'  In short... my idea... Pour the heart back into the business, bring the 'third place' back, and then see what of the ancillary nonsense (seasonally themed stuffed animals for instance...) is worth keeping.P.S. The licensed stores, at airports and such, never had an conception of the \""heart\"" of the business to start with.  They are exemplary of everything that is wrong with current store operations.  This should be major overhaul project number 2.  At least change all over to Seattle's Best or another in house brand so the good name of Starbucks is not sullied by these establishments.P.S.S. I am now a successful entrepreneur, and I look to hire former Starbucks employees, because they truly are great, well trained, hard-working people.  It's the environment, energy and motivation (or lack thereof) that has lead to the service problems... again, it all comes back to the heart of the business. \n",FmrBrsta\n,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=087500000004Di2AAE,Hindsight as a Former Barista,Atmosphere+%26+Locations,320,3/19/2008 2:32 PM)

(5738,"Ever moved to find that an lower level employee or the MANAGER of your most local Starbucks is a complete anti-social, inconsiderate, intolerable, and otherwise bias individual or observed that another employee is excelling in their kindness to a customer and you've had no way to give a higher order the insight of that employee's rude behavior or hospitality.I seriously promote a system of entering credentials towards an employee's actions.  Positive or negative feedback allowed, of course.  I've had the most uncomfortable example of this happening to me.July 1st, I moved to East Ridge, TN, and upon coming to this new location I went job hunting immediately. I applied for a job at the closest Starbucks, upon coming across the location, I asked for a application, and was redirected to printing one off of the internet, minor problem.Upon returning I turned my application in to a lovely employee who actually, while on break, had a conversation with, and she promoted the idea of me joining the work force, because like her, I'm a kind individual.  Or at least I like to think that living positively is a good thing.  By this point I had questioned about the Manager of her shift, and she exclaimed that he was a mean person.I went to said Starbucks today, same manager, and I bought a drink.  It was me and my younger brother, he's 15.  We get condiments from a small station set up for sugars, substitute sugars, ect.  And we sat back down.  We went back because I was going to tell my little brother about the layout of this station and the manager tells us that we've had enough, as if to tell us that we are not welcome in this area of the store, while explaining to us that we are holding up customers, which, there were none waiting to use the station, nor were we blocking the entire station.So we don't fight him, we accept and walk back to seating area.  While there, I continue to look back over at the employees at work, inspecting the areas where the flavors, additives, and utensils were properly at use and the technique of these workers.  I remind you, that I had put an application in, and this was the place I was looking forward to work at.  I'm watching, and I catch the manager's eyes.  He promptly walks around the counter and tells me and my younger brother to leave the establishment because we aren't welcome there anymore.  I would give the considerate employee his job. Fire him, and give her job to someone more worthy to work with people.After explaining the situation with him, he abruptly told me that he was not appreciative of my work ethic, in which I wanted to know how to do the job. He refused to tell me his name.  I still refuse to file a complaint.If it's not the manager's worry to support his social responsibility, and in doing so, promote a hospitable atmosphere in which someone can enjoy their time, spend it in a comfortable, and overall welcoming place of work or congregation, then morality is truly low.I highly admire the employee who would rather converse with you than look at you as a fellow human being.  I will try my hardest to bring this to the attention of a higher authority.   Customer Input is vital to success on a customer satisfaction level.

(12738,"Here's my idea, how about letting us have overtime for starters. How about better pay? People always say \""Well Starbucks is great for students and part time work...\"", and it is, BUT what about the people who depend on it? What about the people who go all out to create that third place and take pride in their work and their drinks? I've been with this company for three years now and I've gotten to know a lot of people that work for this company too. I met my gorgeous bride-to-be here. I see a ton of people all with the same thoughts and ideas but no outlets because they're convinced their voice won't be heard or will not matter. These are a few things that these people are thinking: I get mad watching these videos that are sent to every store asking for every ounce of our personalities to help move products and new drinks and gives us nothing in return. I do not understand why Starbucks will not reward it's \""partners\"" (who have built up some senoirity but cannot move up in the company because of the ridiculous time availability) with FULL TIME hours. Why cant we have people who work at night and people who work during the day be able to move up? WHY NO OVERTIME? Why does my benefit cost increase more than my pay and hours? Why do they keep increasing the prices and pushing the Starbucks Card(now with card benefits) causing our tip rate to fall? Why can't HOWARD see that the drop-off of so-called \""drink quality\"" has to do with the high turnover rate? I have a child and refuse to miss him grow-up so my manager can make BONUS! Where's OURS? Why is some outside hire of a GENERAL MANAGER FROM PANERA BREAD who has been with the company for a couple months talking to me about frappucino procedure ( constantly glancing down at a note card to make sure he's got it right) making my job more stressful than it already is? Starbucks, to my understanding, kept people coming because of us. If that's true, why are we getting the short end?   I have 20 hours this week because we're training employees for another store a half mile down the same street. This store will cannibalize us, our buisness, our tips. Our manager will say we're not pushing products hard enough, causing us to be stressed and our attitudes will suffer. Then that will affect your $ALE$. Why can't a single mother work her schedule around her child's life but some 21 year school kid will always have the day of class off? Why are baristas, who just started(3 WEEKS IN) getting more hours than I do? Why are my lunches being deducted when I work thru them? Why am I working thru lunches, because you keep hiring people who DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING!! Why don't we get PAID LUNCHES?! Why if my schedule says 5:45pm to 11:45pm(closing shift), A. I have to take a lunch even though we'll leave at 11:15, 11:30 and B. If we do stay til the end time on our schedule we get cussed out for not being fast enough? Some of this is illegal! PAY US FOR LUNCH!  Why don't the people who put their butts on the line everyday(KEEPING YOUR CUSTOMERS COMING BACK And I've had customers change stores just because I did, so don't think we don't have an effect, that you just tell us we do) a little more share? Something with an immediate result.         It's not even all about money with some of us, we would just like a little respect, recognition and appreciation. How about when managers know damn well we hand out M.U.G. awards but only give us a 1 on our review sheet in that category? How about the fact that there is so much roll-over, it seems like were training someone new every other 2 weeks? That gets VERY stressful. You really have to get this job down to \""flow\"" right. Respect that! How about a little respect for us, like knowing that YES this is just a job and that our family comes first! Don't threaten us with your scare tactics and the threat of a write-up because you couldn't make it to work BECAUSE YOUR CHILD WAS ILL! I love it when my manager calls me in a few hours early because he/she wants to leave(even though they did nothing on the floor as the schedule would have you believe) but then GOD FORBID WE have an emergency and have to come in a few hours late. Even though you asked the people working there if they'd be alright and they understood telling you not to worry, the manager writes you up. Then it looks like they are on top of their store. All we want is the same respect given to the up-aboves. If I can't work Wed afternoons because my son has soccer practice,and I've given THREE WEEKS NOTICE I expect to NOT BE SCHEDULED ON WED!! RESPECT!      They shot down the idea of a union. They made us sign papers when IWW tried to start up with this company. At first I didn't think we needed it, but with time came more and more incidents with different managers and district managers doing the same things all in the name of BONUS!  I'm not saying, get us a union. I'm saying \""DON'T MAKE US WANT ONE!\""  These are things that WE, YOUR MONEY COLLECTORS, discuss on the floor every three days, if not, more frequently. You wanna bug the stores? There you go, I just saved you a ton of money. Now, put it back into your workforce. Don't turn Starbucks into Wal-Mart!       I am a barista who has to work at Starbucks right now. Not to say I don't love my job cuz I do. There are certain things I absolutely adore. I love my customers and their stories and lives. I love my co-workers as much as I hate the ones I despise. I don't know if that makes sense to you, but I know it does to them.      Bottom line Howie (or whoever polices this) you make a happier workforce, you get better attitudes. You get better attitudes, you get many more pleased customers. More customers, more revenue...more tips, more product \""nudging\"". Give us the respect we deserve! Take care of your baristas who stick with you, who've been here awhile or who keep coming back. I do what you ask me. I sell what you want and inform myself of products, coffees, tastes and pairings. I stress the 3rd place environment to the people I don't even care for, the rude customer and guy who crosses the line when flirting. I can't move up in the company because I'm not free from 4am to 11:45pm every day of the week?! We have lives and children. At least pretend that you care so I don't feel so used and expendable.

(13998,"I am here to ask my loyal customers to help save this company I have come to love.    When I first started with Starbucks 3 years ago it was a lot to take in but the atmosphere instantly won me over. I could easily compare my work experience with previous employers and Starbucks was more than a paycheck, it was \""the third place\"" for me as well as my customers.  Working with partners in their 3rd, 4th, and 5th year with the company instantly proved I had found a job I could enjoy.  Customers would approach their barista with gifts for holidays and birthdays, and ask about their family members by name.  Managers and partners alike putting in mind boggling hours to keep their store running smoothly.  I was told that Starbucks believed in their customer and partner satisfaction more than the product we sold, it was a new approach to business that inspired me to care about my customers... my friends.    Sadly over the course of the last year I have witnessed a painful change in the company that is tearing it apart from the inside out.  New district managers are hired in with no previous experience with Starbucks, transferring our best store managers to slower stores and replacing them with managers who, although amazing in their own right, are not prepared for such high volume(stress) stores.  We have been receiving our schedules as late as Friday night for the following week and fellow baristas have the unfortunate responsibility of telling customers we are out of at least one product every shift worked.    All of these stresses have left our partners exhausted and frustrated which, although we try and brush off, inevitably becomes noticeable to our customers.  This decline in support from senior management has lead to nearly every one of our seasoned partners to jump ship.  It no longer surprises me when a \""regular\"" comments on how they no longer recognize anyone because their faithful baristas that have served them for 6 years are suddenly gone.  Currently my store has 2 assistant managers, a store manager, and an ever more present district manager, meanwhile my fellow partners who must live off of our wages complain about our 3% labor cut.       Over the course of my time with the company I have seen individual stores RUN solely on the backs of baristas and store managers.  I do not assume to know the tasks of senior management, but fail to see how it is integral to keeping individual stores running.  New beverages and switching the focus of the company on a weekly basis has not slowed the decline the company finds itself in.  I propose the company be restructured and taken back to its roots... where the barista/customer relationship was the essence of the company.

IMPLEMENT THE IDEA UNDER REVIEW TO REWARD THE LOYAL STARBUCKS CUSTOMER FREE BEVERAGES WHEN THE PURCHASE A GIVEN NUMBER OF DRINKS WITH THEIR STARBUCKS CARD. MAKE THE CUSTOMER FEEL LIKE THEY'RE SAVING MONEY WHEN THEY BUY COMBINATION SPECIALS WHERE THE PRICE OF THE COMBO SAVES THEM MONEY BY BEING CHEAPER THEN BUYING EACH ITEM SEPERATELY. PROMOTE THE MUSIC SALES BY OFFERING THE CUSTOMER A DISCOUNT WHEN THEY BUY CD'S OR DOWNLOADS FROM STARBUCKS. PROMOTE THE BAGS OF COFFEE BY OFFERING THE CUSTOMER A DISCOUNT ON A BEVERAGE IF THEY BUY A BAG OF COFFEE. It's the old idea that if by any promotional method a small or moderate decrease in price results in greater volume of sales, great enough to offset the price reduction, it's possible to generate greater profits. EXPERIMENT WITH A FEW STORES TO SEE WHAT COMBO OR PROMOTIONAL TECHNIQUE WORKS THE BEST. THEN PROCEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN ON A LARGER SCALE. STUDY THE CUSTOMERS WHO RESPOND TO THIS. STUDY THE LONG TERM RESULTS OF THE PROMOTIONS. MAYBE NO PROMOTION IS GOOD FOR LONG TERM RESULTS AND STARBUCKS NEEDS TO MIX UP THE COMBOS AND PRODUCT DEALS. MAYBE AFTER THE PROMO THE CUSTOMER WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THE COMBINATION OF ITEMS THAT WERE PURCHASED AS A SPECIAL AT THE FULL RETAIL PRICE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CUSTOMER DEVELOPS A HABIT OF BUYING A MUFFIN WITH HIS/HER LATE. SOME PROMOTIONS COULD GENERATE ENTHUSIASM AND EXCITEMENT. EXPERIMENT, SEE WHAT REALLY WORKS. WOULD A FREE TICKETS TO 6 FLAGS WORK? HOW ABOUT A DRAWING OR CONTEST FOR TICKETS TO A BASEBALL GAME? ALWAYS STUDY THE RESULTS. WHO GOES FOR THE PROMOTIONS? THEN TAYLOR THE PLAN ON A SMALL SCALE. TRY IT ON A LARGER SCALE, INVOLVING MORE STORES. MAYBE PARTICULAR LOCATIONS GIVE BETTER RESULTS THEN OTHERS. YOU CAN GO THROUGH PERIODS OF OFFERING SPECIALS AND DISCONTINUE THEM AND SEE IF THE CUSTOMERS STILL CONTINUE TO BUY THE SAME VOLUME OF PRODUCTS OR ENOUGH PRODUCTS TO GENERATE MORE PROFIT. IT COULD BE LIKE TRAINNING AN ANIMAL TO DO A TRICK. THE REWARD IS NOT GIVEN EVERY TIME. THE CUSTOMER MAY BECOME CONDITIONED TO EXPERIENCE PLEASURE WHEN HE/SHE PURCHASES A COMBINATION OF STARBUCKS PRODUCTS. THOUGH STARBUCKS CUSTOMERS HAVE LESS DISCRETIONARY INCOME TO SPEND, PROPER MARKETING TECHNIQUES CAN INDUCE THE CUSTOMER TO MAKE EMOTIONAL SPONTANEOUS DECISIONS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS.

Go to your local Starbucks wearing a ribbon that represents your political worldview: Blue for Democrat, Red for Republican, White for Independent.

Maybe youll come across someone outside of Starbucks wearing a different colored ribbon. Maybe someone will ask you why youre wearing the ribbon.\n5. Vote on this Starbucks idea and ask Starbucks to provide ribbons and pins at the cash register.\n6. Post this to your Facebook page. Tweet it. Tell your friends.

Kennedy-King College is one of the seven City Colleges of Chicago.\nI would like to propose a new store in Englewood at the Northwest corner of 63rd and Halsted Streets. The site is currently an empty lot, so a store would need to be built from the ground up. Why would a Starbucks be a good idea?\n1) Jobs. The Englewood community needs jobs. Students need jobs. It would be a great way to get help get a community back to work.\n2) Redevelopment. The Halsted and 63rd Street shopping district was once one of the highest grossing districts in the city in its heyday (I believe that Englewood was annexed into the city for that reason.). Today Englewood is a community struggling for rebirth. A new Starbucks would help jumpstart the development that has started further east: a new grocery store, and a development anchored by Walgreens, Dunkin Donuts (and you could give them competition) and other restaurants.\n3) Because they say it can't be done.

I'm constantly doing little extra special things for my clients and for the colleagues I rely on every day to get things done for me.Many times I have wanted to include an electronic gift certificate in an email when asking someone for a favor or thanking them for a nice order.I wish Starbucks would offer this option. Currently the only option offered is to order a prepaid card to be sent out to the recipient.Waiting 4-5 business days for a gift card to be mailed to the person just doesn't work. timing is everything.I can't see their being a problem with counterfeiting because each certificate would have a unique bar code that could only be used once or act like a regular card.Ticket-Master uses this for most of their major events. You print your tickets at home and they scan them at the door.Here's how I would like to see it work:Ideally I would type an email to a client, save it, go online to Starbucks and buy the certificate, I would receive an email from Starbucks with a PDF document of the certificate which I would save to my desk top.I would then attach this document to the email and send it to my client.The recipient would receive my email, open the attachment, print it (the certificate) take it to Starbucks where the bar code would be scanned and they would buy their favorite Starbucks treat.The remaining balance would still be attached to the bar code on the certificate or could be transferred to a plastic Starbucks card if the client had one or wanted to buy a new card with additional money on it.Benefit to Starbucks:1-if a balance remains on the certificate it may go unused because it is unlikely that a business person is going to carry around a 8.5\""x11\"" sheet of paper folded up in their pocket for a week.2-if it is made easy ans provides instant gratification you will get more impulse spending = more revenue for Starbucks.3-if the client is printing their own certificates Starbucks increases revenue without investing in more stores or making and shipping Starbucks cards.4-if this is a service in demand Starbucks builds stronger customer loyalty by giving us (the client) what we want.If anyone at STARBUCKS thinks this is a good idea and decides to implement it, please send me an email so I know the service is available.

At times when she couldn't understand what the customer was saying, she would point or hold up something to make sure that she got the order right.

It comes in many flavors, can be used in all pastries and drinks, thus making your chain the first health conscious coffee chain in the world. Sugar is a deadly substance that is killing America, slowly but surely. The studies are out there, and they are scary. Our entire country is consuming an average of 540 lbs. of sugar a year.

There has to be shrinkage from those racks. -Fully outsourced replenishment with UPS. -24/7 access to all sales and inventory data via the proprietary software management system that manages the network of kiosks. -Extremely high revenue/square foot as we only need 2-3 square feet per unit and a plug. The unit can also act as Wi-Fi hotspot and checks into the central server via the cellular network. -Allows barista's to concentrate on the romance and theatre of making and serving coffee. The unit also is interactive and very easy to use so creates another form of theatre for customers. -New business opportunities as the kiosk can print tickets and coupons. If your recording artists are planning a tour you can drive traffic to stores by offering ticket sales exclusively for the first week only in the sores via the kiosks.

(89273,"\nThe health benefits of matcha tea exceed those of green tea because when you drink matcha you ingest the whole leaf, not just the brewed water.\n\nOne glass of matcha is the equivalent of 10 glasses of green tea in terms of its nutritional value and antioxidant content.\n\nA cancer-fighter, a fat-burner, and much more, matcha leaves other green teas far behind\nEvery day, countless people throw away valuable antioxidants and minerals. While seemingly unimaginable, thats exactly what happens when you brew a cup of green tea because water can only extract a fraction of green teas benefits. The majority actually remains unused, trapped in the tea leaves. In reality, the only way to truly take advantage of green teas full potential is to consume the entire leaf. But that doesnt mean you need to start eating tea leaves. The simplest solution is to just enjoy a bowl of matcha. Because matcha is straight, stoneground tea leaves, matcha provides you with green teas powerful arsenal of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and amino acids in a way no other green tea can. In fact, to even begin to match the potency found in a single serving of matcha, you would need to drink at least ten cups of brewed green tea. When it comes to helping you achieve and maintain optimum health, matcha is without equal.\nORAC to the Max: Matcha Is an Antioxidant Powerhouse\nOne of biggest the buzz words in nutrition, antioxidants are naturally occurring chemical compounds that prevent aging and chronic diseases. Nowadays, a variety of fruits and vegetables are lauded for their antioxidant properties, leading to a host of products with all kinds of claims. But matcha is unparalleled in comparison. Firstly, matcha is packed with exponentially more antioxidants according to the latest innovation in antioxidant research. Using the testing method known as ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity), experts at Tufts University discovered that matcha possesses an amazing twenty times more so than pomegranates or blueberries. Matchas ORAC rating is a mighty 1300 units per gram, compared to pomegranates 105 units per gram or blueberries 91 units.\n\nEnergy Booster\nOne of the most unexpected benefits matcha drinkers experience is a boost of energy through the day. In one study, researchers had thought that this was from the caffeine in matcha, but they found that it was actually the combination of matchas natural properties. Another recent study in particular found that matcha even improved physical endurance by 24%. Even if you arent facing a grueling workout, matcha can help you through the everyday marathon, whether its that project due the next day or getting the kids from school to soccer practice.\nCalorie Burner\nAlready nearly calorie free, matcha is a great addition to a weight loss program by tackling the problem from both sides. It boosts metabolism and burns fat. One recent study even suggested that matcha may help burn calories by four times. At the same time, matcha does not put any stress on the body. It doesnt raise blood pressure or heart rate, making it a safe alternative to questionable quick fixes or pharmaceuticals ridden with side effects.\nDetox Deluxe\nGreen is truly the color of health. Matcha helps to safely cleanse and purge the body of harmful elements. Chlorophyll the element that gives green tea and other plants their signature verdant color is also a powerful detoxifier, helping to eliminate both chemicals and heavy metals from the body. And because matcha is carefully shade-grown, it is substantially richer in chlorophyll than other green teas, making it a superior daily detox.\n\nAmongst its many benefits, matcha...\nIs packed with antioxidantsincluding the powerful EGCgBoosts metabolism and burns caloriesDetoxifies effectively and naturallyCalms and relaxesEnhances mood and aids in concentrationProvides vitamin C, selenium, chromium, zinc and magnesiumFights against viruses and bacteriaIs rich in fiberLowers cholesterol and blood sugarDoes not raise insulin levels\nThe Catechin EGCg: Matchas Incredible Cancer-Fighting Antioxidant\nEven better, matcha also contains a unique, potent class of antioxidant known as catechins, which arent found in other foods. In particular, the catechin EGCg (epigallocatechin gallate) provides potent cancer-fighting properties. Most importantly, EGCg and other catechins counteract the effects of free radicals from the likes of pollution, UV rays, radiation, and chemicals, which can lead to cell and DNA damage. Since over 60% of the catechins in matcha are actually EGCg, a daily matcha regimen can help restore and preserve the bodys integral well-being and balance.\nEffortless Calm: The Unique Amino Acid L-Theanine\nOver a thousand years ago, matcha came to Japan as an aid to meditation practice. During long hours of sitting, monks would drink matcha to remain alert yet calm. Modern science has recently confirmed the lessons of centuries of tradition. Matcha is rich in L-Theanine, a rare amino acid that actually promotes a state of relaxation and well-being by acting upon the brains functioning. While stress can induce beta wavesan excited, more agitated stateL-Theanine creates alpha waves, which lead to a state of relaxed alertness. And while L-Theanine is common in all tea, matcha may contain up to five times more of this amino acid than common black and green teas. As an additional benefit, L-Theanine may help memory and learning and ability all the while inhibiting any possible side-effects from caffeine, a natural component of green tea. Therefore, a bowl of matcha promotes concentration and clarity of mind without any of the nervous energy found in coffee. Try matcha as a pick-me-up for the afternoon or anytime you need extra focus.\n\n",wayneholbrook\n,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=08750000000I2kbAAC,I would love Starbucks to start selling Matcha Tea (hot) along with your other hot teas.,Tea+%26+Other+Drinks,-150,4/23/2012 6:52 AM)

We are the #2 busiest Starbucks in the state. We are also the only 24 hour Starbucks in the state, which means, I work the graveyard shift! When working the graveyard shift at a trauma 5 university hospital, you are quite busy taking care of doctors, nurses, patients and their families, along with kids who want coffee at 3 am and drive all the way north from Provo (BYU country... GO UTES)! So working all night long there are times when you get tired, and too much coffee amps your body out, so when Starbucks came out with the refreshers it was a nice alternative to coffee, it's cold, lightly caffeinated and delicious with flavor! Now, the only thing we needed to do was \""up\"" the caffeine level without making it a crazy amount! So one night I decided to try something out, I mixed the Tazo Black iced tea with the Very Berry Hibiscus Refresher and came up with the solution! Now, it's started as just myself drinking it, but when the nurses and doctors saw the beautiful Tazo Black Tea Refresher in my hands beautifully garnished with the freeze dried Blackberries and orange slices they were curious about what it was, so I started sampling it out, THEY LOVE IT! Though it took many different tries to obtain the right mix of tea and refresher we have reached a final product, with more being worked on at the present moment along with other ideas. Now I'm needing your help to vote for me! Show Starbucks I have an amazing idea and let them know how much you love my drink!

Maybe it's something the \""brass\""  expects you to do every so often?  Or maybe someone in the Art Department needed to justify a position or two?  Not sure.   But let's say sales of old ones were getting sluggish, and Marketing felt people would not buy two of the same mug, but they might buy another mug if it was interesting (or horrid).\n\nI can accept that logic.  But here's my idea:  What if you had a \""second edition\"" of the mug come out with a different perspective of that same city, or a different point of interest?  So Washington, DC could have the Washington Monument on one, but the next year (or two or whatever) it could be the cherry blossoms (maybe with a pink interior - THAT would be cool).  And then maybe a few years later one could come out depicting a few of the War Memorials? Or the National Cathedral?

The mix now seems too sweet, and what happened to the malt? Please go back to using malt. And the texture has changed. And quality varies a great deal from store to store. Some frappuccinos are too icy, but usually they are too thin and watery. A good frappuccino should have some heft, with a great fresh coffee and chocolate flavor. Creamy, but not slimy. But, I am one of the lucky ones--spouse has figured out how to make these at home, and they are fabulous.

I personally love to get a soy strawberries and cream frapp. However there is a (shall we say) cultish group that remembers what the original frappucino tasted like, and misses it. The original frapp definitely felt more like drinking iced coffee than a canndy bar, and I think Sbux could capitalize on this by launching one drink that uses the old Frapp method. The Classic Frapp or the Traditional Frapp. Sort of a back to basics angle. An old fashioned summer angle or a rustic Italian summer angle.\n",latte_girl00\n,http://mystarbucksidea.force.com/ideaview?id=08750000000JXmTAAW,The Classic Frapp,Frappuccino+Beverages,-10,1/9/2014 7:15 AM)
