Histogram Set Bins Test01:

The purpose of this test was to check basic functionality of the histogram
adt program. The test begins by initializing an array of bins with random
numbers. After this, we will set the bins with an array where the max is not
the final element of the list. This will cause the validate method to report
a message stating that the array is not sorted in order.
