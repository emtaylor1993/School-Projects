Histogram Set Bins Test01:

The purpose of this test was to check basic functionality of the histogram
adt program. The test begins by initializing an array of bins with random
numbers. After this, we will set the bins with an array that contains a gap.
This will cause the validate method to report a message stating that the
array of bins contains a gap.
