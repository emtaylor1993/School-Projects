Histogram Get Height Test 03:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this test was to check the basic functionality of the
histogram get height test. For this test, we will test calling the 
"histogram_get_height" method after an invalid set call for width. This should
still work because height is independent of stride.
