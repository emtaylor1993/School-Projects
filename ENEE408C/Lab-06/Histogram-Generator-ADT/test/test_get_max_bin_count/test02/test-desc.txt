Histogram Get Max Bin Count Test 02:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this test was to check the basic functionality of the
histogram get max bin count test. For this test, we will test calling the 
"histogram_get_max_bin_count method once and see if it will get the width as
it should. The key difference here, is that we will call the getter method
with a negative value.
