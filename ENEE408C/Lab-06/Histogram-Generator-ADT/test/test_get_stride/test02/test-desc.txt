Histogram Get Stride Test 02:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this test was to check the basic functionality of the
histogram get stride test. For this test, we will test calling the 
"histogram_get_stride" method once and see if it will get the stride as
it should. The key difference here, is that we will call the getter method
AFTER setting it with another number.
