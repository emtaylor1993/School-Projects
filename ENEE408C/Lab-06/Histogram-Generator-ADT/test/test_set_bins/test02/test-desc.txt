Histogram Set Bins Test 02:
------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this test was to check the basic functionality of the
histogram set bins test. For this test, we will test calling the 
"histogram_set_bins" method normally and see if the bins are actually set. This
time, we will test on a much larger set of bins.
