Histogram Set Bins Test 03:
------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this test was to check the basic functionality of the
histogram set bins test. For this test, we will test calling the 
"histogram_set_bins" method normally and see if the bins are actually set.
This test calls the method on sets of bins that have greater ranges.
