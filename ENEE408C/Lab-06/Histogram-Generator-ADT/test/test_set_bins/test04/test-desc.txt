Histogram Set Bins Test 04:
------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this test was to check the basic functionality of the
histogram set bins test. For this test, we will test calling the 
"histogram_set_bins" method normally and see if the bins are actually set.
This method was called with an invalid set of bins. As you can see, the
bins are still set but a message returns to stderr stating that the bins
are not valid.
