Histogram Validate Bins Test 02:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this test was to check the basic functionality of the
histogram validate bins test. For this test, we will test calling the
"histogram_validate_bins" method once and see if it will validate a
perfectly valid set of bins. This time, the set of valid bins will be
much larger.
