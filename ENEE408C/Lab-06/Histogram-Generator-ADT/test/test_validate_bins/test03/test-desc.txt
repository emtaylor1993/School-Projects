Histogram Validate Bins Test 03:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this test was to check the basic functionality of the
histogram validate bins test. For this test, we will test calling the
"histogram_validate_bins" method once and see if it will validate a
perfectly valid set of bins. This time the bin list will have much larger
ranges.
