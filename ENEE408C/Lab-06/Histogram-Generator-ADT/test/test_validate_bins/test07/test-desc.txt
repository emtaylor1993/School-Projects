----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this test was to check the basic functionality of the
histogram validate bins test. For this test, we will test calling the
"histogram_validate_bins" method once and see if it will validate a
set of bins that is invalid. Particularily, if there is a gap in the list  
of bins.
