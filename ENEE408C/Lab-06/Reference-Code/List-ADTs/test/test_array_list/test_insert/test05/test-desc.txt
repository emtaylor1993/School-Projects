This test inserts a large number of integer elements specified within 
driver.c into a list. The integers are stored in a buffer; each integer
is inserted into the list and compared with the corresponding value in 
the buffer. It outputs the number of inconsistent values. If all 
insertions succeed, the number of inconsistent values should be 0.
