Explain your computations.Q = [3 -5 -9;8 7 -6;-5 -8 3;2 -2 -9]y = [-4; -8; 6; -5]AugmentedQ = [Q y]ReducedAugmentedQ = rref(AugmentedQ)%%% Y is in the subspace of R4 spanned by the columns of Q if and only if% X1*Q1 + X2*Q2 + X3*Q3 + X4*Q4 = Y has a solution. By solving the% augmented matrix of Q and y, we see that there is a solution for every X.% This means that y is in the subspace of R4 spanned by the columns of Q.%% Problem 2%%% Let H = Span{v1, v2, v3} and B = {v1, v2, v3}. Using MATLAB, show that B% is a basis for H, and x is in H, and find the B-coordinate vector of x% for v1 = [-6; 4; -9; 4], v2 = [8; -3; 7; -3], v3 = [-9; 5; -8; 3], and x% = [4; 7; -8; 3]. Explain your computations.v1 = [-6; 4; -9; 4]v2 = [8; -3; 7; -3]v3 = [-9; 5; -8; 3]x = [4; 7; -8; 3]zero = [0; 0; 0; 0]B1 = [v1 v2 v3 zero]reducedB1 = rref(B1)%%% Since Bx = 0 has only the trivial solution, this shows that the vectors% v1 v2 and v3 are linearly independent. Because it spans and is linearly% independent, it is considered a basis.B2 = [v1 v2 v3 x]reducedB2 = rref(B2)%%% The solution of the augmented matrix shows that x is in the span of H.% The B coordinate vector of x is [3; 5; 2].%% Problem 3%%% Let P = [1 2 -1;-3 -5 0;4 6 1], and v1 = [-2; 2; 3], v2 = [-8; 5; 2], and% v3 = [-7; 2; 6].P = [1 2 -1;-3 -5 0;4 6 1]v1 = [-2; 2; 3]v2 = [-8; 5; 2]v3 = [-7; 2; 6]%%% *Part A:*% Show that B = {v1, v2, v3} is a basis for R3. Explain your computations.zero = [0; 0; 0]B = [v1 v2 v3 zero]reducedB = rref(B)%%% The solution of this augmented matrix shows that there are three% variables in R3 which means that it spans and is linearly% independent, therefore B is a basis of R3.%%% *Part B:*% A change-of-coordinate matrix is always invertible. Verify that P can be% a change-of-coordinate matrix in R3. Explain your computations.inverseP = inv(P)%%% The nonzero determinant shows that the columns are linearly independent% with three variables.%%% *Part C:*% Find a basis C = {u1, u2, u3} for R3 such that P is the% change-of-coordinates matrix from C to B.u1 = 1*v1 - 3*v2 + 4*v3u2 = 2*v1 - 5*v2 + 6*v3u3 = -1*v1 + 0*v2 + 1*v3C = [u1 u2 u3]%%% *Part D:*% Find a basis D = {w1, w2, w3} for R3 such that P is the% change-of-coordinates matrix from B to D.syms b1 b2 b3x = [b1; b2; b3]M = [1 -3 4;2 -5 6;-1 0 1]augP = [M x]reducedP = rref(augP)w1 = 5*v1 - 3*v2 - 2*v3w2 = 8*v1 - 5*v2 - 2*v3w3 = 5*v1 - 3*v2 - v3D = [w1 w2 w3]%%% *Part E:* % What is the change of coordinates matrix from C to D? Explain how it% relates to P.CD = P^2%%% Because we found that P equals the change of coordinates matrix from C to% B and from B to D, going from C to D is the same as P squared.%% Problem 4%%% Let P be the matrix P = [7 -9 -4 5 3 -3 -7;-4 6 7 -2 -6 -5 5;2 -7 4 2 -6 % 1 8;-3 5 8 -1 -7 -4 8; 6 -8 -5 3 7 9 3]P = [7 -9 -4 5 3 -3 -7;-4 6 7 -2 -6 -5 5;2 -7 4 2 -6 1 8; -3 5 8 -1 -7 -4 8; 6 -8 -5 3 7 9 3]%%% *Part A:*% Construct matrices C and N whose columns are bases for ColP and NulP,% respectively, and construct a matrix R whose rows form a basis for RowP.% Explain your computations.reducedP = rref(P)C = [7 -9 -4 5 -3;-4 6 7 -2 -5;2 -7 4 2 1;-3 5 8 -1 -4;6 -8 -5 3 9]N = null(P)R = reducedP%%% C contains the columns of the original matrix that have pivots while N% calls the null function to find the nullspace of P. R contains the% nonzero rows of the reduced echelon form of P.%%% *Part B:*% Construct a matrix M whose columns form a basis for NulPTranspose.% Explain your computations.Ptranspose = P'reducePt = rref(Ptranspose)M = null(Ptranspose)%%% The matrix of P transposed has linearly independent columns so it has the% trivial nullspace.%%% *Part C:*% Using standard matrix manipulations in MATLAB, form the matrices S =% [Rtranspose N] and T = [C M].Rtranspose = R'S = [Rtranspose N]T = [C M]%%% *Part D:*% Explain why S and T should be square. Verify that both S and T are% invertible.Sinverse = inv(S)Tinverse = inv(T) %%% S should be a square matrix because it is made up of R transpose, a 5 by% 7 matrix, and N, which is a 2 by 7 matrix. Together they form a 7 by 7% sqaure matrix. %% T should be square because C is a 5 by 5 matrix and M is an empty matrix.% Therefore, T should be a 5 by 5 square matrix. %% Both matrices are invertible.%%% *Part E:*% Compute C * R and discuss what you see.CRproduct = C * R%%% This multiplication gives you the original matrix. This shows that by% mulipling the basis of the colP by the basis of rowP, you get the% original matrix P.%% Problem 5A1 = [0 1 0 0;0 0 1 0;0 0 0 1;-2 -4.2 -4.8 -3.6]B = [1; 0; 0; -1]A2 = [0 1 0 0;0 0 1 0;0 0 0 1;-1 -13 -12.2 -1.5]M1 = [B A1*B (A1*A1)*B (A1*A1*A1)*B]M2 = [B A2*B (A2*A2)*B (A2*A2*A2)*B]Rank1 = rank(M1)Rank2 = rank(M2)%%% Since Rank1 is not equal to n, which is 4, it shows that the matrix pair% is not controllable.%% Since Rank2 is equal to n, which is 4, it shows that the matrix pair is% controllable.
